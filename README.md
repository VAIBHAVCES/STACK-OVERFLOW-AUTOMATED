# STACK-OVERFLOW-AUTOMATED

## MOTIVE
All of software developers refer to variety of different software development platforms for solving errors in their code and one of most popular is STACKOVERFLOW . But finding most relevant answers sometimes becames tough task so that's why I thought of resolving this issue by righting an automation script for it.

## SOLUTION 
So by observing the problem carefully I have made this script which can gives you 3 most closest and relevant question near to your question and 3 most praised solution each for that problem and scrap it into a file **solutions.js** where you can see all of your text and code . Also one thing speciall is that i have refined both text and code differently so that i can quickly see code instead of reading som irreleveant text. And in a case if there is not any solution for your problem then by putting a **wanna_post** parameter as true , by providing question descriptive data in **questions_data** file and adding your **credentials.json** file you can post your question in just matter of seconds
